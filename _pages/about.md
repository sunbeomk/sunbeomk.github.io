I am a Ph.D. student in the Quantitative Psychology program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in psychometrics and latent variable modeling. My current research includes item response theory, response times, copula theory, structural equation modeling, problem-solving process data analysis, Bayesian analysis, and AI evaluation.

I earned an M.S. degree in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an M.A. in Psychology from Sungkyunkwan University. I completed B.A. degrees in Psychology and Statistics at Sungkyunkwan University.
