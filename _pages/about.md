I am a Ph.D. student in the Quantitative Psychology program at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I earned an M.S. degree in Statistics from UIUC and an M.A. in Psychology from Sungkyunkwan University. I completed B.A. degrees in Psychology and Statistics at Sungkyunkwan University.

I am interested in psychometrics and latent variable modeling. My current research includes item response theory, structural equation modeling, copula theory, Bayesian analysis, problem-solving process data analysis, and AI evaluation.
